Some points about structure of the project
--------------------------------------------

After downloading the project, you have to open it with bat-file "_0_Open Project Elevated  - !!! - .cmd"

The entry point is Sub Main() in: modInit.bas

After initialization, form frmEULA.frm or frmMain.frm has been started.

Functions call stack while system scanning is looking like this:

"Do a system scan and save log file" button -> cmdN00bLog_Click -> cmdScan_Click -> SaveReport -> StartScan -> CreateLogFile (process list)

'StartScan' contains the list of all sections to scan, like CheckO1Item(), e.t.c ...

The results of scanning are beeing saved in SCAN_RESULT structure as well as fix directives.

Each 'Check' procedure has appropriate 'Fix', like CheckO1Item() <-> FixO1Item().

All other modules and forms are self-explained according to its names.

Best wishes,
Alex.
